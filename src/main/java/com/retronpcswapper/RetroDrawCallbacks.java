/**
 * Decorates the renderer currently holding {@code Client.setDrawCallbacks} (in practice the
 * bundled GPU plugin) so retro geometry can be substituted for an NPC at draw time.
 *
 * <p>Only {@link #drawTemp} does anything other than forward: temporary entities (NPCs, players,
 * projectiles, spotanims) are drawn through it, and the {@code Model} arrives as a parameter, so
 * handing the delegate a different one is enough to change what is rendered. The delegate keeps
 * doing all the actual upload work.
 *
 * <p>Every other method forwards verbatim. This is deliberate and load bearing: the methods on
 * {@link DrawCallbacks} are {@code default} no-ops, so any method left un-overridden here would
 * silently drop that part of rendering rather than fail loudly - omitting
 * {@link #drawScenePaint} alone would make terrain disappear.
 *
 * <p>Note the clickbox is unaffected by substitution. Under the ZBUF path the client resolves the
 * model, culls clickboxes and registers the hit target before invoking these callbacks, so the
 * clickbox continues to describe the original model. That addresses the "modifying, moving, or
 * resizing the clickboxes of in-game elements is strictly prohibited" rule.
 *
 * <p>The same split is why anything that outlines an NPC through the API - {@code Actor#getModel()}
 * is read-only and never routes through here - traces the original silhouette rather than the one
 * on screen. {@link com.retronpcswapper.compatibility.RetroInteractHighlightOverlay} redraws
 * those outlines around the substituted geometry, so the highlight follows what is rendered while
 * the clickbox still follows the original model, and the two can disagree at the edges.
