/**
 * Turns unlit HSL face colours into the per-corner lit colours the renderer draws.
 *
 * <p>Needed because {@link ModelData#light()} only works on a model the client itself decoded, and
 * injected geometry by definition is not one. Lighting is baked once, at rest pose, exactly as the
 * client does it - animation moves vertices afterwards and the colours are not recomputed.
 *
 * <h2>Output encoding</h2>
 *
 * The renderer reads three parallel arrays of packed HSL, one per triangle corner, and two values in
 * {@code faceColors3} are sentinels rather than colours:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code -1} - flat shaded, so {@code faceColors1} applies to the whole face</li>
 *   <li>{@code -2} - hidden, the face is skipped entirely</li>
 * </ul>
 * Both matter: {@code SceneUploader} and {@code Zone} count drawable faces by testing
 * {@code faceColors3 != -2}, so getting these wrong changes what is drawn rather than just how it
 * is shaded.
 *
 * <h2>Known limit</h2>
 *
 * Per-face render types (flat vs gouraud vs hidden) are not exposed on {@link ModelData}, so when
 * they are unavailable every face is treated as gouraud, which is what the overwhelming majority of
 * models use anyway. Geometry loaded from our own bundles carries the real types, since
 * {@code net.runelite.cache}'s {@code ModelDefinition} decodes them.
