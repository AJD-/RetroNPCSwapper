 * that makes a skinner necessary - and, usefully, it is also what makes a custom rig format
 * possible at all.
 *
 * <p>A port of {@code ModelDefinition.animate} from the cache library, with one deliberate change:
 * vertices are floats here, as they are in the modern client, so the fixed-point shifts of the
 * original become float divisions. Everything else - the op types, the rotation encoding, the order
 * the axes are applied in - is kept as-is.
