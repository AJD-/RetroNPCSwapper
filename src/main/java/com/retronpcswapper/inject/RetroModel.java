/**
 * Geometry this plugin owns, presented to the renderer as a {@link Model}.
 *
 * <p>This is the whole point of the injection work: it makes it possible to draw a mesh that has no
 * live cache id at all, which is the only way to bring back assets Jagex overwrote.
 *
 * <h2>Why this can be handed to the renderer at all</h2>
 *
 * {@code Model} is an interface, and the GPU plugin consumes it purely through
 * {@code invokeinterface} - {@code GpuPlugin.drawTemp} to {@code ModelUploader.uploadTempModel} /
 * {@code uploadSortedModel} contains no {@code checkcast} anywhere. Verified against
 * client 1.12.38.
 *
 * <h2>The three places this must never go</h2>
 *
 * Everything else in the client casts to the obfuscated concrete model class:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code Client#applyTransformations} - unguarded cast, throws {@link ClassCastException}.
 *       <b>This is why injected geometry cannot use the client's animation system</b> and has to be
 *       skinned in Java instead.</li>
 *   <li>{@code Client#checkClickbox} - unguarded cast. Never reached in practice: the client
 *       registers the clickbox itself after {@code drawTemp} returns, using its own model.</li>
 *   <li>An <b>active</b> {@code RuneLiteObject} - the cast there is caught, so the failure is
 *       silent: it logs "Exception rendering RuneLiteObjectController" and draws nothing. Passing
 *       one to {@code ModelOutlineRenderer} is fine, because that only reads the interface.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Which methods carry data</h2>
 *
 * Only the ones the GPU plugin and the outline renderer actually read. The accessors gated behind
 * a render flag return null, and that is safe rather than lazy: {@code GpuPlugin.setupGpuFlags}
 * sets only
 * {@code GPU | ZBUF | RENDER_THREADS}, never {@code HILLSKEW}, {@code NORMALS} or
 * {@code UNLIT_FACE_COLORS}, so the gated accessors are never called. {@code drawFrustum} and
 * {@code drawOrtho} belong to the software rasterizer, which is not in use under the GPU plugin.
 *
 * <p><b>Maintenance cost, deliberately accepted:</b> {@code Model} has no default methods, so a
 * RuneLite release that adds one breaks compilation here. Nothing pins the client version to stop
 * that: {@code build.gradle} resolves {@code latest.release}, matching the example-plugin template,
 * and the Hub rebuilds against whatever is current regardless of what a plugin asks for.
 *
 * <p>That cuts two ways, and the difference matters. Through the Hub the failure is loud and
 * contained - the rebuild fails, the plugin is delisted until it is patched, and no user ever runs
 * a jar missing a method. A <b>sideloaded</b> jar is the dangerous case: it meets whatever client
 * the launcher runs, and a method added since it was compiled surfaces at runtime as
 * {@link AbstractMethodError} inside the uploader - an {@code Error}, which the GPU plugin's
 * {@code catch (Exception)} will not contain.
 *
 * <p>So the mitigation is upkeep rather than a version range: when {@code Model} changes, this
 * class changes with it. The interface was last read in full against client 1.12.38.
