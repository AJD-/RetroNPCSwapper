/**
 * Merges the parts of a multi-model NPC into one mesh the way the client merges them, so the parts
 * share one vertex list and one rig space.
 *
 * <p>This used to happen in the generator, with the merged result stored under the first part's
 * model id. That could not express the giant family, where five NPCs are one shared body mesh plus
 * a variant head: every one of them keys on 2870, so the last spec written would win, and they would
 * all wear the same head. The bundle now stores each part under its own real model id - keeping the
 * "keyed by the ids the source caches use" invariant, and storing a shared body once - and the
 * merge happens here instead, once per NPC id at spawn.
 *
 * <p>Parts share one coordinate space; there is no per-part translation, because 2005 parts are
 * authored to sit together already.
 *
 * <h2>Vertices are welded, not concatenated</h2>
 *
 * The client's {@code ModelData} merge runs every face corner and texture triangle corner through a
 * lookup that returns any vertex already merged at exactly the same position, and only appends a new
 * one when there is none. So where a head or limb part meets the body, both parts' faces end up on
 * one shared vertex, and that vertex keeps the bone of whichever part reached it first - the body,
 * since it is listed first. When the limb swings, its faces stretch back to the body's seam rather
 * than parting from it. Concatenating instead leaves each part its own copy of the seam, and the
 * pieces visibly separate as soon as they move; it also counts every seam vertex twice in the pivot
 * centroids the animation turns about.
 *
 * <p>Three more consequences of the same rule, all matching the client: vertices are numbered in the
 * order faces first reach them, duplicates within one part weld too, and a vertex no face or texture
 * triangle names is dropped. Positions are compared exactly - the client compares integer-cast
 * coordinates, which is the same thing for the integer geometry a cache model carries.
