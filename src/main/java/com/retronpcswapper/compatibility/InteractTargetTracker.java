 * <p>This mirrors the actor half of RuneLite's Interact Highlight plugin, whose own state is
 * package private and cannot be read from here. Only the actor half is reproduced: while this
 * plugin draws NPC outlines, that plugin is still the one drawing objects, ground items and
 * players, with its own code and its own state.
