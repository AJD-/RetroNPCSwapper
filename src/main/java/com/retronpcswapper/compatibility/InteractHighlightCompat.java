/**
 * Turns off Interact Highlight's own NPC outlines while this plugin draws them instead.
 *
 * <p>An outline has to be suppressed rather than painted over: the outline renderer writes straight
 * into the frame buffer, so a second overlay drawing later only adds a second outline. Interact
 * Highlight's overlay is package private and cannot be filtered or subclassed, but its config
 * interface is public, and it reads that config on every frame - so clearing the two NPC keys stops
 * it drawing NPCs on the next frame while it goes on drawing objects, ground items and players with
 * its own code.
 *
 * <p>The previous values are stashed in this plugin's own config group, not held in memory, so a
 * client that dies while suppressing is repaired on the next startup rather than leaving the user's
 * Interact Highlight settings off for good.
