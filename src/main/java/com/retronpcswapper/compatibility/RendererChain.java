 * Sees through the stack of model-substituting decorators sitting in the draw callbacks slot.

 * <p>This plugin and Custom NPC Models each wrap the renderer to swap NPC models, and can stack on
 * top of one another. They are loaded by different classloaders, so neither can name the other's
 * decorator type. Instead, each decorator also implements {@link Supplier}, a JDK type both can see,
 * returning the callbacks it wraps. Only the decorators named here are unwrapped: anything else is
 * treated as the bottom of the chain, and a partner build too old to implement {@code Supplier} is
 * not unwrapped either, so the two keep standing each other down exactly as before.
